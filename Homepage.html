            <p>
                Howdy folks. I'm Kit (they/them), a BICT student in Finland.
                <br>
                I moved to Finland late 2020 during the panini (Covid-19 pandemic) with my partner due to a job offer they received. 
                I'm originally from South Africa, but will be staying in Finland permanently. 
                <br>

                <br>
                I study Business Information Technology at Haaga Helia University of Applied Sciences (AMK).
                <br>
                My major has been in Software Engineering, but my true passion lies in Video Game Development.
                <br>
                I've facilitated the springboarding of my focus from my foundation in Software to my future in Game Dev 
                by incorporating courses from other universities and platforms to my education.
                <br>
                My estimated graduation date is Fall 2024 or Spring 2025. 
                <br>
               
                <br>
                I love gaming in all of its forms, from cards and tabletop RPGs, to video games on various consoles. 
                <br>
                You can find me playing Angry Birds Dream Blast and Merge Mansion on mobile, or at Cafe Board Game
                playing Dungeons and Dragons or any number of board/card games.
                <br>
                I love Baldur's Gate 3 and Cult of the Lamb on PC but for console, Genshin Impact stays on top.
                <br>
                By now you might be able to tell that I love fantasy, adventure, storytelling, and world-building.
                <br> 
                When I'm not playing games, I'm learning how to make them, check out my Unity Play to see some of the projects 
                I've been working on.

                <br>
                My other interests are reading/watching fantasy, spending time outdoors with my dog, and visiting anime conventions in 
                the summertime.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm part of the LGBTQIA+ community and equality and inclusivity are of paramount importance to me.
                <br>
                My values are integrity, kindess and honesty.
                <br>
                I work hard and do my best.
                <br>
                My biggests strengths are innovation, creativity and determination.
                <br>
                These combine into my super strength: figuring it out. 
                <br>
                If I don't know how to do something, I use my innovation, creativity and determination to figure out how to do it.
