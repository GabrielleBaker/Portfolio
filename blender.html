                This project was part of the XAMK Introduction to Video Games Creation Course
                <br>
                The robot was modeled in Blender and imported to Unity.

                <img src="images/Blender/Room1.png" alt="trainingapp" class="cleared-image">

                This project was the final project for my Basic 3D Design with Blender course at Haaga Helia.
                <br>
                The goal of this course was to utilize everything we learnt in the course and implement it into a room with 
                a minimum of 8-12 items.
                <br> 
                This is the room I designed and modeled. 
                <br>
                This is an artist's gallery, this artist loves painting cats, they are inspired by their pet cat.
                <br>
                There is a glass egg chair hanging by a chain from the ceiling. An easel with a painting. A surfboard which was refurbished 
                as a coffee table. Coffee cups and coasters. A barrel which was refurbished as a side table. A lamp, a cat bed and food and water bowls.
                A plate of meatballs. An ashtray with a cigarette in it. Two cushions at the surfboard table and a side chair with a fabric texture on the cushion.
